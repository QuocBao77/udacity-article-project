### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

I choosing a web app service over a virtual machine. Cost-wise, the web app wins hands down with its pay-as-you-go model, saving cash. Plus, you ditch the VM maintenance headache, freeing up your time and energy. Deployment becomes a breeze thanks to the seamless GitHub integration, getting your app live in a flash. High availability is built-in, so your users enjoy consistent uptime. And when it comes to scaling, the web app adapts to your needs effortlessly, avoiding the manual VM configuration struggles. Furthermore, the web app service excels in simplicity and speed. The seamless integration with your GitHub repository allows for effortless deployment with just a few clicks. This streamlines your workflow significantly compared to the cumbersome setup and configuration of a VM. Based on the costs, scalability, availability, and workflow analysis I chosed the web app service to deploy for my project article.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.* 

Should the application's security demands escalate, necessitating advanced protective measures, and if its architecture grows in complexity through the adoption of microservices, integration of diverse technologies, and an influx of users, I would incline towards employing a virtual machine. In such scenarios, the inherent flexibility of virtual machines proves indispensable for effectively controlling and managing these evolving requirements.
